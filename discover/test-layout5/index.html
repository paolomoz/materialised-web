    <!-- Troubleshooting Steps -->
    <div>
      <div class="troubleshooting-steps">
        <div>
          <div>1</div>
          <div>Unplug your Vitamix</div>
          <div>Always disconnect power before inspecting blades or the container. This ensures your safety during the troubleshooting process.</div>
          <div>safety:Never reach into the container while plugged in.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>2</div>
          <div>Check for trapped ingredients</div>
          <div>Remove the container and look underneath the blade assembly. Hard seeds, ice chips, or food particles can get trapped and cause grinding sounds. Use a soft brush to clean the area.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>3</div>
          <div>Inspect the drive socket</div>
          <div>Look at the centering pad and drive socket on top of the motor base. Check for wear, cracks, or debris. A worn drive socket is a common cause of grinding noises and is easily replaceable.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>4</div>
          <div>Test with container removed</div>
          <div>Without the container attached, briefly turn on the motor to listen for the noise. If grinding persists without the container, the issue is in the motor base and requires professional service.</div>
          <div>safety:Run motor for no more than 3 seconds without container.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ Section -->
    <div class="section highlight">
      <div class="faq">
        <div>
          <div><h3>How long do Vitamix blades last?</h3></div>
          <div><p>Vitamix blades are designed to last the lifetime of the machine under normal use. They are intentionally dull and work by creating a vortex rather than cutting. If you notice reduced blending performance, the issue is usually wear on other components rather than the blades themselves.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div><h3>Is grinding noise covered under warranty?</h3></div>
          <div><p>If your Vitamix is still under the standard warranty (5-10 years depending on model), grinding noises caused by manufacturing defects or normal wear are typically covered. Contact our support team with your serial number for a warranty assessment.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div><h3>Can I replace parts myself?</h3></div>
          <div><p>Yes, many parts like the drive socket, centering pad, and container assembly are user-replaceable. We offer these parts in our online store with easy-to-follow installation guides. For motor-related issues, professional service is recommended.</p></div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div><h3>What if the noise started suddenly?</h3></div>
          <div><p>Sudden grinding noises often indicate something got trapped under the blade or in the drive socket. Check for hard objects like cherry pits, ice fragments, or utensil pieces. If nothing is trapped, inspect the coupling between the container and base.</p></div>
